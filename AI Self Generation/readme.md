# LSTM-based Code Generation with Keras

This project demonstrates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to generate code snippets using the Keras library. Given an initial sequence of code (seed), the model predicts the next possible characters to generate a longer, coherent piece of code.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the required libraries using `pip`:




## Usage

1. Save your code snippets to a file named `code.txt`. The model will be trained on this data.

2. Run the provided Python script to train the model and then generate a code snippet. The trained model weights will be saved in a file named `weights.best.hdf5`.

3. If you wish to generate more code snippets after training once, you can directly call the `generate_code` function without retraining the model. Ensure that `weights.best.hdf5` is in the same directory as the script.

## Note

Training the model may require considerable computational power and time, depending on the size of the `code.txt` file. It's recommended to run the training on a machine with a decent GPU for faster results.
